 MFD Structure 1.0 enhancement Ignition Engine Keplerian Newtonian

The project is quickly reaching a level of complexity that will require more sophisticated tools to test the project. The most important step here will be to create a MFD class that can receive very general information about the state of the simulation and synthesize it up onscreen as a readout for the user to view. The best idea for this would appear to be to have the MFD object draw to an sf::Texture on demand, ie

then passing on the texture to the main loop to get drawn.


Map view image flickers back and forth depending on time acceleration 1.0 bug Graphics Ignition Engine Newtonian Physics

When going back and forth between time accelerations while controlling the GL-01 in map view, 
the image of the GL-02 jitters back and forth like it did with the old issues seen in map view, 
and its position seems to be related to the current time acceleration. 
Damn, thought this particular problem was dead, but no such luck I guess.

Overloaded function for generic state loading 1.0 enhancement Newtonian

Instead of doing everything by hand in a vessel types constructor, we want 
to make loading of states generic in Newtonian objects, 
ie something like a init_newtonian() function which handles the setup of newtonian specific stuff.


Multiple Camera orientations 1.0 enhancement Graphics Ignition Engine

Right now the camera stays oriented vertically with the in-universe coordinate system, 
and orients itself relative to the current vessel. 
This is somewhat dangerous with using the pointer to track the current vessel, and not flexible enough,
the camera should be its own entity that looks at the current target. 
Also needs to be able to rotate around relative to the current vessel orientation, 
which will need a different sorting function for determining whether an object is in camera view.

==Proposed idea==

move TVessel into its own file pair separate from the newtonian stuff.
its getting too big for one file again...
